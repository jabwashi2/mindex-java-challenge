Coding challenge for Mindex :)

## planing and other things
task 1: make new type
- ReportingStructure
-- employee (type: string) <-- employeeId
-- numberOfReports (type: int)

We'll get these numbers based on the number of directReports each employee has
- employees don't have the directReports value if they have no directReports, so check if directReports exists (if not, numberOfReports = 0)

There is an employee class, will likely need another class for the reporting structure (since employee class is for type: employee)
